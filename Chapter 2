Programming Exercises
1. Write a program to implement Type Casting Operator.
2. Write a program to implement Borrowing and Dereferencing Operators

1.Code 
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
    let a=15;
    let b=(a as f64)/2.0;
    println!("{}",b);
}

2.Code 
fn main() {
    let x = 5;      // Declare a variable x
    let y = &x;     // Borrow x by creating a reference y

    println!("x: {}", x);  // Prints: x: 5
    println!("y: {}", y);  // Prints: y: 5 (y is a reference to x)

    // Dereference y to access the value it points to
    let deref_y = *y;  // Dereference y to get the value it refers to (which is 5)

    println!("Dereferenced y: {}", deref_y);  // Prints: Dereferenced y: 5
}
